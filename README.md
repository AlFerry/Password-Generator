# Password-Generator

This project can be used to create a random, secure password of chosen length for a user containing the character types of their choice. This type of password is important in today's age where data can be easily accessed by hackers for malicious purposes. Using a secure password that cannot be guessed protects users and their information.

This program will prompt a user to choose whether various character types should be included in their password, and how long their password should be.

This program will then let a user know if their password criteria is not valid (too short or no character types chosen) and why it is not valid. 

If the user chooses valid password criteria, a password will be generated and displayed that is the correct length and contains random characters of types that the user selected.
